# Guess_State_name_game
🛠️ What I used:
	•	Python 🐍
	•	turtle graphics for visualization
	•	pandas for data management
	•	CSV file with custom X, Y coordinates for each state
	•	GIF image of the India map as background

💡 Features:
	•	Shows the guessed state on the map at the right place.
	•	Keeps track of correct guesses.
	•	Exits gracefully and creates a CSV file for the states you still need to learn.
